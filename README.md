# CS Webring - George Brown Polytechnic

A webring to feature some of the most cracked CS students at George Brown Polytechnic and give them a place to showcase their personal sites. It's also a way for current students to discover alumni and connect with people who've been through the same programs. Each member is a node on a maple leaf visualization.

## Add the widget to your site

Once you're in the ring, add the GBP Huskies logo to your portfolio so visitors can find the webring. It links back to gbp-ring.com where they can browse all members.

<img src="assets/husky.svg" alt="GBP CS Webring" width="40" height="40" />

Paste this anywhere in your HTML:

```html
<a href="https://gbp-ring.com" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://gbp-ring.com/assets/husky.svg" alt="GBP CS Webring" width="40" height="40" />
</a>
```

If your portfolio uses React/JSX:

```jsx
<a href="https://gbp-ring.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://gbp-ring.com/assets/husky.svg" alt="GBP CS Webring" width={40} height={40} />
</a>
```

That's it - a small husky icon that links to the ring. Put it in your footer, sidebar, or wherever you like.

If you're just browsing, give the repo a star - it helps more GBP students find the ring.
